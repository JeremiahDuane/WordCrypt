<p>
Welcome to this Cross-Reference and Proofreading Technology, denoted as WordCrypt.<br><br>

This webpage was created by myself, Jeremiah Gage, for the students of College of The Ozarks. 
WordCrypt is a text editor that scans essays for “deadwords,” a list of over 100 words that 
are banned in composition essays for being inspecific or overused 
(list located to the right). WordCrypt highlights these words, and displays the total number of deadwords
in the document. From this total, WordCrypt calculates a score based on the current College Composition
I grading scale. <em>Please note,</em> this only grades based on deadwords. Grades are almost certainly
less than the generated percentage, which is why the panel denotes "&asymp;" instead of "=". Also, all graddes are rounded to the nearest percent, so take all values as aproximates. <br><br>

It currently only checks for deadwords, but will eventually be modified to cross-reference 
any words the user chooses. If you have any questions about WordCrypt, please contact us 
through the “Contact” tab.
